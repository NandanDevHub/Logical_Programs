### Hello World


In C#, you cannot write Console.WriteLine statements (or any other code) directly inside a class without
wrapping them in a method, constructor, or a property. This is because the C# language specification requires
executable statements to be placed within a method osr similar construct.

C# enforces the concept of structured execution within specific contexts.
